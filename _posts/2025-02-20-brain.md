title: I Love u
---

Every time I think about you, my mind changes the memory just a little, making it brighter, warmer, more perfect. The first moment we met? My brain doesn't just replay it. it paints over it like an artist adding the colour to an already beautiful picture. That's how love works. It grows more beautiful every time you remember it. It's like my brain is trying to capture how much you mean to me, but it can never quite get it right vecause every new moment with ou is even more perfevt than the last.
From the moment I saw you, my heart had already decided. I didn't choose to love you. My mind had already built a world where you existed before I could even understand it. It's like an algorithm running in the background, quietly rewriting my entire life around you. and now, there is no version of my world where you don't exist.

My mind doesn't just see the world as it is. It predicts, it completes, it fills in missing places. That's why when you're away, I still hear your voice in my head, still feel your existence beside me. My mind refuses to accept your absence. So it keeps you close, painting you into my world even when you're miles away. Even in silence, you are there. Even in distance, you never truly leave.

No matter how mucch information my brain processes, it always slows down for you, as if you are the only thing that truly matters. Just one smile, one whisper of your voice, one memory of your touch can override the rest of the universe. Since the moment you entered my life, my brain has changed to include you in every plan, every dream, every late-night thought. My mind has rewritten itself to make room for you, and now, you are in every corner of it. Even when I don't say your name, my thoughts whisper it in between sentences, in between heartbeats, in between moments.

My mind is always running in the background, indexing every memory of you, always bringing you back to me the most beautiful result of an endless search.

Even in my dreams, you are there. Since the moment you entered my life, my mind has changed. My world has changed. And if you're still reading this... you are my favourite thought.
